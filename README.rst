UEFI Runtime Tests
==================

Getting the source
------------------

The project is hosted on Github. You can download it with

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/xypron/efirttest

Configuration
-------------

Directory configs/ contains the template configuration files for the maintained
boards following the naming scheme::

    <board>_defconfig

These files have been stripped of default settings. So you cannot use them
directly. Instead their name serves as a make target to generate the actual
configuration file .config. For instance the configuration template for ARM
64bit qemu is called qemu_arm64_defconfig. The corresponding .config
file is generated by

.. code-block:: bash

    make qemu_arm64_defconfig

You can adjust the configuration using

.. code-block:: bash

    make menuconfig

Building
--------

When cross compiling you will have to specify the prefix of the cross-compiler.
You can either specify the value of the CROSS_COMPILE variable on the make
command line or export it beforehand

.. code-block:: bash

    CROSS_COMPILE=<compiler-prefix> make

Assuming cross compiling on Debian for ARMv8 this would be

.. code-block:: bash

    CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- make
